  bio: "Hey there! I'm an aspiring full-stack developer on a hands-on journey through the world of web development, machine learning, and everything in between. From designing interactive front-ends with React to building solid back-end APIs and exploring the logic behind intelligent systems, I'm constantly learning, building, and improving. I believe growth comes from getting my hands dirty with real projectsâ€”some work, some break, but all teach something new.",
